From Sholom:
ok. give me a few minutes..I have a few errands to run
[3:20:40 PM]  Forumla #1 is a straight up function so it is easy to code up
[3:20:45 PM]  formula
[3:46:30 PM] Bryan Downing: ok
[3:49:11 PM]  the other formulas are 2) general expectation which is another function
[3:52:48 PM]  3) is a conditional probability based on a filtration (historical price path) coding this up is a lot more complicated. best bet is to google the following: 1) coding a PDF/CDF, 2) coding an expectation function, 3) coding a conditional PDF/CDF
